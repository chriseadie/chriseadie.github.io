              <p>VBase is a student volunteering centre located at Edinburgh Napier university. VBase have an issue where they would like to increase the
                number of students from the school of computing. VBase would also like to create a community out of volunteering at Edinburgh Napier and
                encourage students to come back and be apart of something else.</p><br><p>V base wished to also come up with a concept for gamifying
                  the experience as well through applying a points system based on opportunities that the students had completed.
                  The idea of using a tinder based approach for students to select their opportunities was also conceived as a new
                  a way of having student interact with the application.</p><br><p>For designing V Base a usable solution
                    Human centred design method was used to approach the problem. This method allowed insight to be
                    made from what students actually wanted from V Base and from their experience volunteering.
