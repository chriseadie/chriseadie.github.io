          <p>Eva Solo is a culinary company based in Denmark. They sell a variety of products on their website
            and are the dominant market in Denmark Sweden and Norway
            Eva solo tasked us with creating a concept for an advertising campaign that could be
            used on the web as well as on TV, The idea was to promote a new range of pots that had been developed
             with a new concept for a lid that could stay up by itself and would also allow you to pour water out
             without removing it.</p>

          <br>

          <p>The concept that we presented to Eva solo was a video idea about different uses for the lid if their
            pot and for them to kind of poke fun at their own brand. The video would be show casing different scenarios 
            to which the pot and lid could be used or played with.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Ideas for the video ranged from an indiana jones based theme to setting up the pots to look like a drum kit.
            The second part to the advertising campaign was to make it a viral hit to do achieve this we wanted to make the
            whole experience of poking fun at the pot a customer experience as well getting them to come up with more creative
             ways to use their pot.</p>
