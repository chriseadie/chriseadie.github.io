            <p>Eva Solo is a culinary company based in Denmark. They sell a variety of products on their website and are the dominant market in
              Denmark Sweden and Norway Eva solo tasked us with creating a concept for an advertising campaign that could be used on the web as
              well as on TV, The idea was to promote a new range of pots that had been developed with a new concept for a lid that could stay up
               by itself and would also allow you to pour water out without removing it.</p><br><p>The concept that we presented to Eva solo was
                  a video idea about different uses for the lid if their pot and for them to kind of poke fun at their own brand. The video would
                   be show casing different scenarios  to which the pot and lid could be used or played with.
                 </p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Ideas for the video ranged from an indiana jones based theme to setting up the pots to look like a drum kit. The second part to the
                    advertising campaign was to make it a viral hit to do achieve this we wanted to make the whole experience of poking fun at the pot
                     a customer experience as well getting them to come up with more creative ways to use their pot.
