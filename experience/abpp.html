          <p>This project was taken from my exchange in germany and I decided to redesign the interface
            using a web framework. This was to give the application a more neural feel and a non bias towards any
            particular mobile operating system</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Anything but Pesto Pasta is a concept application designed to help students with what meals they could
            cook with just the things they have in their cupboards or in the fridge and this application would
            help them by finding recipes with most of the ingredients they had.</p>

          <br>

          <p>The most noticeable differenceÂ to the interface is that it is not longer build with just block colour
             like the older interface. This re designed version has also had the navigation changed as well moving
             from an iOS design principal design to a web application design.</p>

          <br>

          <img src="../images/phone.png" id="phone">

          <br>
          <p>Web applicaion design have the menu as a side bar in the top left hand corner of the page. This can be seen
             in other applications like Youtube.com which the function of the side bar is to show navigational elements
             such as your youtube profile, subscription and playlists that youve made.</p>
          <br>

          <p>The aim was to create an easy to use interfaces and an experience that felt familiar from start to finish. Whilst
            the original interface was based around iOS design principals that meant that all of the navigation had to be contained
            in the bottom half of the screen. Whilst this does make it easy to use this also leaves out the android half of the market
             so our reach to students was limited.</p>

             <p>Changing the type of navigation to web allows the application to stretch its demographic to more users, Since the app is
                no longer platform specific everyone no matter what device they use will have the same experience. There will be a small
                 learning curve attached the the web app as users get used to the experience but it keeps it mobile platform neutral</p>
