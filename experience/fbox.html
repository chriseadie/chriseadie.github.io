          <p>A small storage company called Family Box needed a website that would allow their
            customers to find out more information about what they do and to help them sign up
            a get a one of the storage packages that they offer. The website is targeted towards
            small business that need help keeping some of their more important
            documents off site.</p>

          <br>

          <p>The website needed to be accessible to a wide audience and so the ability for the website
            to be responsive was a large priority.The website was built using a W3 CSS framework which
            was then re-coded and changed to fit the needs of Family Box. All of the icons and graphics
            used throughout respond with the site so the users receive the same experience no matter
             which device they use.Family Box also required some graphic design work to be done. </p>

          <br>

          <p>I designed the logo for the business, they wanted to incorporate the idea of
            security into the logo and after some brain storming the idea was to put the
            combination lock for a vault into the logo to replace the O in box. This was
            to encompass the element of security into the logo.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Once they were happy with the logo this lead to designing business cards, letter heads
            and envelopes. With the use of the graphic branding this help make the company come across
            to to their clients as more professional.</p>
