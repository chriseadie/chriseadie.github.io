          <p>V Base is a student volunteering centre located at Edinburgh Napier university. V Base have an issue
            where they would like to increase the number of students from the school of computing. V Base would also
            like to create a community out of volunteering at Edinburgh Napier and encourage students to come back
            and be apart of something else.Â </p>

          <br>

          <p>V base wished to also come up with a concept for gamifying the experience as well through applying a points
             system based on opportunities that the students had completed. The idea of using a tinder based approach for
              students to select their opportunities was also conceived as a new a way of having student interact with
              the application.</p>

          <br>

          <p>For designing V Base a usable solution Human centred design method was used to approach the problem. this
            method allowed insight to be made from what students actually wanted from V Base and from their experience volunteering.</p>
